# Rabbit Hunting Game

## Overview
Rabbit Hunting is a dynamic and interactive game developed as part of the Programming 1 course at the University of Jyv채skyl채 (JYU). The game, written in C# using the Jypeli game library, was last updated in 2022 and is designed in Finnish. It offers a fun and engaging way to explore game development basics and reflects my initial steps in software development, showcasing fundamental programming skills in a practical project.
